## Default Elasticsearch configuration from Elasticsearch base image.
## https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/distribution/docker/src/docker/config/elasticsearch.yml

#We already set cluster name in docker compose via environment veriable
#cluster.name: "docker-cluster"
network.host: 0.0.0.0
http.port: 9200

## X-Pack settings
## see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-xpack.html


## we are adding a basic password authentication on our elastic search server so if any service like kibana, 
## beats want to tallk with elastic search they need to authenticate with the password first then communication is happend.
## And we are seting this super user elastic password from using docker compose environment veriable "The default username is 'elastic'".
xpack.license.self_generated.type: basic
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled: true




# ========Default Configuration sample==============
# ======================== Elasticsearch Configuration =========================
#
# NOTE: Elasticsearch comes with reasonable defaults for most settings.
#       Before you set out to tweak and tune the configuration, make sure you
#       understand what are you trying to accomplish and the consequences.
#
# The primary way of configuring a node is via this file. This template lists
# the most important settings you may want to configure for a production cluster.
#
# Please consult the documentation for further information on configuration options:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/index.html
#
# ---------------------------------- Cluster -----------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for your cluster:
#
#cluster.name: my-application
#
# ------------------------------------ Node ------------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for the node:
#
#node.name: node-1
#
# Add custom attributes to the node:
#
#node.attr.rack: r1
#
# ----------------------------------- Paths ------------------------------------
#
# Path to directory where to store the data (separate multiple locations by comma):
#
#path.data: /var/lib/elasticsearch
#
# Path to log files:
#
#path.logs: /var/log/elasticsearch
#
# ----------------------------------- Memory -----------------------------------
#
# Lock the memory on startup:
#
#bootstrap.memory_lock: true
#
# Make sure that the heap size is set to about half the memory available
# on the system and that the owner of the process is allowed to use this
# limit.
#
# Elasticsearch performs poorly when the system is swapping the memory.
#
# ---------------------------------- Network -----------------------------------
#
# By default Elasticsearch is only accessible on localhost. Set a different
# address here to expose this node on the network:
